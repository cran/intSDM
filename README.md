The goal of *intSDM* is to assist users in creating a reproducible
workflow for large-scale integrated species distribution models (ISDM).
The package does this by providing the tools and functions to obtain
speciesâ€™ occurrence data from [GBIF](https://www.gbif.org) and
environmental covariates from [WorldClim](https://www.worldclim.org),
specify the components of an ISDM, estimate the model, and produce
useful outputs. The package estimates the ISDM using a Bayesian
framework with the [integrated nested Laplace
approximation](https://rss.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/j.1467-9868.2008.00700.x)
method, which is computationally efficient in comparison to MCMC
methods. Furthermore, the package builds wrapper functions around
[inlabru](https://besjournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/2041-210X.13168)
and
[PointedSDMs](https://besjournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/2041-210X.14091),
two *R* packages designed to simplify modelling spatial processes and
integrated species distribution models respectively. As a result, good
knowledge of both these packages is required before using *intSDM*.

The outputs of the model are objects which are typically useful in
species distribution modelling analyses. These include: models,
predictions, maps of predictions and cross-validation scores. The
default of *intSDM* is to produce single-species models and outputs;
however the package does also allow multi-species models to assist the
user in obtaining estimates of species richness.

## Installation

You can install the development version of this package from
[GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
#install.packages('devtools')
devtools::install_github("PhilipMostert/intSDM")
```

or directly through CRAN:

``` r
install.packages('intSDM')
```

## Functionality

The package contains two main functions: `startWorkflow` which
initializes the workflow, and `sdmWorkflow`, which estimates one of the
specified outcomes of the workflow. `startWorkflow` produces an
[*R6*](https://r6.r-lib.org), which has a multitude of different *slot*
functions to help customize the workflow. These include:
